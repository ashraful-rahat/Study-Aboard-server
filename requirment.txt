ðŸš€ Easy Step-by-Step Backend Development Plan
Step 1: Setup Basic Project Skeleton
Create your Express + TypeScript + Mongoose backend (you already did this).

Setup your .env, database connection, ESLint/Prettier.

Prepare your folder structure (models/, controllers/, routes/, services/, validations/).

Step 2: User Authentication & Authorization
Create User model with roles (admin/user).

Implement Register and Login endpoints.

Use JWT for authentication.

Protect routes (e.g., admin-only routes).

This is foundational because many other APIs need user info.

Step 3: Core Dynamic Entities
Build models, routes, and controllers for key dynamic parts:

Countries (Destinations)

Fields: name, description, image, visa info, popular cities, universities (refs)

APIs: list countries, get by ID

Universities

Fields: name, country (ref), ranking, description, courses (refs), scholarships

APIs: list/filter, get details

Courses

Fields: university (ref), name, description, duration, fees, eligibility

APIs: list/filter, get details

Step 4: Application & Student Dashboard
Application Model

Fields: user (ref), course (ref), documents, status, timestamps

APIs:

Submit application (form + upload)

Get applications by user (for dashboard)

Admin: update status (approved, rejected, in review)

Step 5: Blog, Events, Testimonials
Create separate models and CRUD routes for:

Blogs (title, content, author, date)

Events/Webinars (title, date, registration link)

Testimonials (user, message, video URL)

Step 6: Static Pages
About Us, Contact, FAQs can be either:

Simple static JSON data or markdown content served by API

Or managed dynamically via a CMS or database for easy updates

Step 7: Validation & Security
Use Zod or Joi for request validation.

Add rate limiting, helmet, CORS properly.

Sanitize inputs.

Step 8: Testing & Documentation
Write tests (Jest or any preferred tool).

Document APIs with Swagger or Postman collection.
